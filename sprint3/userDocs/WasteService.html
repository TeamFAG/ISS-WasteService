        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <div class="remark">
            <h3>SCRUM goal</h3>
            In the final sprint of the project, <b>Sprint3</b>, we are going to analyze and create the WasteServiceStatusGUI component.<br/>
            <br/>
            <h4>Gui Service</h4>
            <img src="./imgs/guiarchbase.png" alt="SystemArchRasp" style="width:auto;height:750px;" class="center"><br/> 
            <b>The objectives of this Sprint are:</b>
            <ol><br/>
                <li>
                    <b>Analyze GUI interactions.</b>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Connect the <b>GUI</b> to the system</b>

                    <b>Implement the <k>GUI</k> updating methods</b>
                </li>
            </ol>          
        </div>

        <h2>Problem analysis</h2>
        <div class="remark">

            <h3>Analysis of possible GUI implementations</h3>

            <k>What type of GUI do we want for our system ?</k><br/>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Desktop Application</b></li>
                <li><b>Web Application</b></li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Importance of clean architecture in relation to the UI</h4>
            
            The <a href="https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html">clean architecture</a> is a way of separating responsibilities and parts of functionality according to their proximity 
            to the application domain.<br/><br/>

            By the domain, we mean the part of the real world that we model with a program. This is the data transformations 
            that reflect transformations in the real world.<br/>
            For example, if we updated the name of a product, replacing the old name with the new one is a domain transformation.<br/><br/>

            <center><img src="./imgs/CleanArchitecture.png" width="500px" height="380px"></center><br/><br/>

            In the scheme of the architecture, our GUI component is an <k>external interface</k> and as such it should be
            detatched from the core business logic of the system.<br/>

            <h4>Desktop Application</h4>
            With this strategy, the <b>WasteserviceStatusGUI</b> component is an executable that needs to be installed on the target machine.<br/>
            <ol>
                <li>- The App can be independent from the system (<i>if developed as an external program</i>), however it still will be highly
                    dependent on the <b>OS/platform</b> used to run it.
                </li>
                <li>- If developed as an internal component (part of the qak architecture with a Qak actor/codedActor), it will be
                    too dependent on the system itself, limiting present and future development. 
                </li>
                <li>- Running this application using <b>Docker</b> is always more difficult, as visualization of the GUI needs to be
                    handled inside the container.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Web Application</h4>
            With this strategy, the <b>WasteserviceStatusGUI</b> component runs on an external server as a website.<br/>
            <ol>
                <li>+ The <b>webApp</b> is detached (or independent) from the system.</li>
                <li>+ The customer provides support for this choice by presenting other functioning projects.</li>
                <li>+ There are no <b>OS/platform</b> limitations as the only required application is a browser.</li>
                <li>- Defining the interaction between a Qak based system and an external server could prove to be challenging.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>WasteService to GUI communication handling</h3>
            One of the core problems of this <b>Sprint</b> is the communication of the system and the GUI as the latter needs to be constantly updated
            by the system.<br/>
            Infact, the only porpouse of the GUI is to <b>receive status updates</b> from the service and show them to the manager.<br/>
            Because of this the only two message types that make logical sense are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Dispatches</b></li>
                <li><b>Events</b></li>
            </ul>
            As we already discussed in <b>Sprint2</b>, <b><i>Events</i></b> are sent to all endpoints in the system and represent additional load on the netework.<br/>
            So <b><i>Dispatches</i></b> seem to be the best option.<br/>

            <h5><k>However, after further analysis the team realised that Dispatches require the knowledge of the receiving end of the connection.<br/>
            Which means that they introduce a level of <b>dependency</b> that should be avoided.<br/>
            We will tackle the issue in a separate part of this <b>Sprint</b> document.</k></h5>

            <h3>Update policy</h3>

            <k>How do we know when a gui update is needed ?</k>
            <br/>
            This particular problem is very similar to the <b><i>sonar</i></b> and <b><i>led</i></b> analysis of Sprint2, in which we had to monitor
            the trolley's behavior to update the state of the system.
            <br/>
            Consequently, for the same reasons, we decided to use the <b>Observer</b> pattern by implementing CoaP messaging.<br/><br/>

            Our pre-existing <ks>trolleystateobserver</ks> actor already observes the <k>state</k> ad <k>position</k> of the trolley.<br/>
            It also acts as the notifier for the Led state, so reusing it is the best possible choice.<br/>

<pre><code>Dispatch updateLed : updateLed(STATE)
Dispatch updateRobotState : updateRobotState(STATE)
</code></pre>

            However, one required information for the gui is not being observed. The <k>containers'</k> state.<br/>
            To solve this, we created another observer, <ks>wasteserviceobserver</ks> that runs in the <i>ctxwasteservice</i> qak context.<br/>
            This actor receives CoaP messages sent by the <ks>wasteservice</ks> actor whenever a container is updated by the system (by using <k>updateResource</k> funcitons).<br/>
            Next, it sends Dispatches to notify of the update of the GUI.<br/>

<pre><code>Dispatch updateMaterial : updateMaterial(MATERIAL, QUANTITY)</code></pre>

            <k><i>Who receives these messages ?</i></k>
            We introduced a new actor called <ks>guiupdater</ks> that receives Dispatches from all the update sources (<k>Observers</k>) and
            consequently uses them to create and ultimately send the final update message.<br/><br/>            

            This was done so that the eventual <b>GUI</b> component will only have to receive one type of message from the system, instead of
            having to <b>parse each message differently based on its origin</b>.<br/><br/>
            
            <center><img src="./imgs/guiupdater.png" height="400px"></center><br/><br/>

            <i>For now, the only entity that listens to these updates is a <b>CoaP observer</b> built as part of a <b>Test</b> for this particular analysis.<br/>
            In the project portion of this document we will tackle the issue of the real observer.</i><br/>

            <br/>

                <h5>Test Plans</h5>
                <k>The test plans for this particular Sprint have been developed only for the Project section, as they would have 
                been very similar in both phases.</k><br/><br/>
            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Project</h2>
        <div class="remark">

            <h3>GUI framework</h3>

            As previously discussed, we chose a <ks>Web-based</ks> solution for our GUI service.<br/>

            We chose <b>Spring Boot</b> as a platform to develop the GUI server.<br/>
            We did this for several reasons:
            <ul>
                <li>We first tried to use <b>React</b>, as it's a light, easily developed library with a lot of support.<br/>
                Unfortunately, <k><i>Qak systems cannot communicate with Javascript-based WebSockets</i></k>, for unknown reasons.</li>
                <li>The team was alredy familiar with the framework.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>GUI design</h3>
            As for the <b>GUI design</b>, we wanted to make sure it was as clear and understandable as possible.<br/>
            All assets were used with this in mind.<br/><br/>

            <img class="center" src="./imgs/gui-updated.png" style="width: auto;height: 500px;">

            <h3>Connecting to the Wasteservice system</h3>

            In the problem analysis section of the document, we defined a <b>CoaP based software structure</b> to collect and send
            all updates of the system to the GUI.<br/><br/>

            To finally complete the implementation of this structure, we defined a new object called <a href="../sprint3_project/resources/wsWebSupport/WsDispatcher.kt"><b>wsDispatcher</b></a> the uses
            the <a href="https://github.com/anatali/issLab2022/blob/main/unibo.comm22/src/unibo/comm22/ws/WsConnection.java"><b>WsConnection</b></a> class (provided by the customer), to connect to the GUI server and send all new updates received by 
            <ks>guiupdater</ks>.<br/><br/>

            <h3>Connecting to the Wasteservice system - <k>Solving issues presented while testing</k></h3>

            While testing the previous strategy, we found a system-breaking issue involving <b>CoaP based messaging</b>.

            <h5><k>Receiveing messages from multiple observers</k></h5>

            Apparently, CoaP fails when a <b>QakActor is observing multiple resources</b>.<br/><br/>
            What happens is that of all the messages sent as part of the <k>updateResource</k> function, The observer
            only receives messages from one resource, losing all other messages.<br/><br/>

            In our case, the updates sent by <ks>transporttrolley</ks> were not received by <ks>guiupdater</ks>.

            <h4><k>A new strategy for the GUI interaction</k></h4>

            We then decided to change the whole messaging architecture between the GUI and the Core System.<br/><br/>

            The first thing that has been done is to remove the two actors introduced earlier (guiupdater and wasteserviceobserver).
            <br/>
            CoaP messaging is still used, howerver we moved the observers to the GUI side.<br/>
            Now there is an observer for every resource of our system:
            <ul>
                <li><ks>LedObserver</ks>: observes the <ks>led</ks> actor.</li>
                <li><ks>TrolleyStateObserver</ks>: observes the <ks>trolleystateobserver</ks> actor.</li>
                <li><ks>TrolleyPositionObserver</ks>: observes the <ks>trolleystateobserver</ks> actor.<br/>
                <h5><k>Initially, <ks>TrolleyPositionObserver</ks> observed the <ks>transporttrolley</ks> actor as it 
                was the obvious source of data about the position of the trolley, however we found that 
                it wasn't being correctly observed by the GUI CoaP class. <br/>
                We fixed this issue by incorporating the information about the position of the trolley into <ks>trolleystateobserver</ks></k></h5></li>
                <li><ks>WasteServiceObserver</ks>: observes the <ks>wasteservice</ks> actor.</li>
            </ul>
            Every time an <k>updateResource</k> for one of the observed actors is called, the new kotlin observers receive the update
            and use SpringBoot to push it to the live web-page.

            The consequences of this are:
            <ul>
                <li><b>All updates are independent from one another</b>, which means that the GUI is constantly being updated
                without any delays.<br/>
                However, this also means that the network takes on a bigger load as there are more messages.<br/>
                <h5><k>For the sake of this project, after further testing, this solution doesn't have any big impacts.</k></li></h5>
                <li><b>Coap doesn't behave strangely</b> as no kotlin class observes more than one actor in the Core System.</li>
                <li><b>This strategy makes the GUI component more independent</b> as it can be cahnged, reused and repourposed without 
                affecting the Core System.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Smart Device re-definition</h3>

            Up to this point, our Smart Device has always been a python GUI script that ran inside the main PC.<br/>
            However, while starting to develop the wasteservice GUI, we wanted to make the Deposit Request experience closer
            to the actual real life counterpart.<br/><br/>

            To do this, we chose to create a mobile app that could connect to the system from anywhere, using Sockets.<br/>
            By doing so, we simulate the requesting process completely.<br/><br/>

            As a "mobile framework" we used React Native, which was the better choice for the following reasons:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Versatility</b>: The final app can be adapted for Android and iOS.</li>
                <li><b>Familiarity</b>: As previously discussed, the team is already familiar with the React family of libraries.</li>
                <li><b>Extensive Support</b>: There are many pre-made assets that significantly sped-up the development process.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <h3>MQTT and its possible use in our project</h3>

            Right now, our GUI needs to know the endpoint of the Core System to be able to receive CoaP update messages.<br/>
            This means that there is still some dependency between the two components, which violates the clean architecture mentioned
            in the analysis section of the document.

            <k>How can we completely detach the GUI from the system ?</k>
            <a href="https://mqtt.org/">MQTT</a> is messaging protocol designed for IoT messaging that uses the Pub/Sub design pattern.<br/>
            <br/>

            Messages are sent to/from an entity called <b>message broker</b> that handles the traffic between endpoints<br/>
            Our GUI interaction would greatly benefit from using this protocol as the core system would only need to know the broker,
            not the GUI server.<br/>
            <br/>
            These would be the required steps:
            <ol>
                <li><b>Create a topic</b> on the broker specifically for GUI messages (ex. "<i>guiupdates</i>")</li>
                <li><b>The GUI subscribes to <i>guiupdates</i></b> so that all messages published on that topic are automatically received.</li>
                <li><b>The system publishes all updates</b> on the topic by sending specific messages to the message broker.</li>
            </ol>
            This means that each component involved in the interaction can change and evolve without the need for updates on 
            the opposite endpoint, creating complete independency.<br/><br/>

            The strategy will be implemented as a future update to the service.<br/>

            <h3>Updates to the distribution of the system</h3>

            After the final changes to the <b>architecture</b>, we have updated the methods and tasks for a successful <b>deployment</b>.<br/><br/>

            <k>WasteServiceStatusGUI</k><br/>
            <ks>SpringBoot</ks> is distributed using <ks>Docker</ks>, in a <a href="../distribution/distributed/web/docker-compose.yml">docker-compose.yml</a> file that also executes the <b>virtual environment</b>
            of the robot.<br/><br/>

            <k>Raspberry context</k><br/>
            The actors and classes that execute on the Raspberry are also deployed using Docker.<br/>
            By employing a <a href="https://docs.docker.com/registry/">registry</a>, we upload the <a href="../distribution/distributed/Dockerfile-ctxrasp">rasp</a> Docker image from the PC.<br/>
            Then the image is loaded to the Raspberry and the context is executed.<br/><br/>

            <k>Core System</k><br/>
            In order to run the CoreSystem has been developed a script. This script (<a href="../distribution/distributed/run.sh">run.sh</a>) allows both
            to launch the system by choosing which context to start, and to automate the execution of all the test plans of the whole system.

<pre><code>// run.sh usage:

<b>./run.sh [service] [testplan]</b>

<b>wasteservice := wasteservice | trolley | all</b>
wasteservice -> runs the ctxwasteservice, trolley -> runs the ctxtrolley, all -> runs both the ctxwasteservice and the ctxtrolley

<b>testplan := test1 | test2 | test3</b>
test1 -> execute all the tests that are in the Sprint1 project, test2 -> all the tests that are in the Sprint2 project, test3 -> Sprint3 project tests
</code></pre>
            <br/>

                <dd>
                    We have prepared the following tests for this particular model:

                        <li><a href="../sprint3_project/test/IntegrationTestGuiUpdater.kt"><k>IntegrationTestGuiUpdater.kt</k></a>: Integration testing to ensure the correct behavior of the Gui updates inside the system using CoaP.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h5><k>This previous test helped us understand how CoaP messaging was failing due to the observation of multiple actors, 
                        causing the change in project architecture for the GUI service.
                    </k></h5>
                    After changing the software structure, this is the new test:
                    <ol>
