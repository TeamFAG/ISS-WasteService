        <h2>Problem analysis</h2>
        <div class="remark">

            <h3>Sonar interaction analysis</h3>

            The <k><b>SONAR</b></k> is a component (be it virtual or physical) that continously collects and sends data based on its surroundings.<br/>
            As previoulsy mentioned in Sprint0, this project uses a Sonar that detects object proximity.<br/>
            When the current distance is less than DLIMIT, the trolley must be HALTED. After that, as soon as it becomes higher than DLIMIT, the trolley
            must resume its routine.<br/>

            The sonar's behaviour is exemplified by a script written by the customer: <a href="">sonarDataGen.kt</a>


            <h4>In what form does the trolley receive the information from the Sonar?</h4>

            <h5>RAW DATA: the trolley receives all detection data from the Sonar</h5>
            With this strategy, all distances detected by the Sonar get sent to the trolley.<br/>
            He will then be the one to check every detection for a distance value that is less than DLIMIT.<br/><br/>

            This puts a lot of overload onto the trolley (i.e. <i>receiving a huge amount of data and filtering it</i>), that already has important responsibilities. 

            <!-- immagine tipo con due attori -->

            In a Qak script, the messages would be defined as:
            <pre><code>distance: distance(V)</code></pre>
            Where the payload V represents the protagonist of the "hit" game Cyberpunk2077 deceased December 18 2020. Amongus.<br/>


            <h5>FILTERED DATA: raw data is hidden from the trolley</h5>
            This strategy implies the definition of a "middle man", an entitiy that filters the raw data from the Sonar and presents it to the transporttrolley.<br/>
            By handling all the incoming data with a different entity, the transporttrolley only needs to know when a certain detection has gone under the predefined
            limit (DLIMIT) and when it has subsequently returned above it.<br/><br/>
            
            This division of responsibility makes it so the trolley receives only two messages per HALT (one at the start and one at the end).

            <!-- immagine tipo con due attori -->
            <img src="">
            <br/><br/>
            In a Qak script, the messages would be defined as:
            <pre><code>distance: distance(V)
startHalt: startHalt(_)
stopHalt: stopHalt(_)</code></pre>
            

            As for our model, this "middle man" has been temporarily implemented by the actor
            <k>sonarfilter</k> whose function is to:
            <ol>
                <li>Receive raw data from a mock sonar (more info in the "other tools" section)</li>
                <li>Filter the data by considering the DLIMIT.</li>
                <li>Sending <i>startHalt</i> and <i>stopHalt</i> according to the already analyzed logic.</li>
            </ol>
            

            <h4>Customer's tools</h4>

            In the project section of this Sprint, the sonarfilter actor will be substituted by
            a more complete and detatched filtering system.<br/><br/>

            More specifically, we will use the <k>dataCleaner</k> and <k>distanceFilter</k> codedQakActors
            provided by the customer.

            <h5><k>NOTE</k>: Seing as the messages sent by these components are Events, the previously mentioned messages (<i>distance(V), startHat(_), stopHalt(_)</i>)
            have been also defined as Events.</h5>

            <h4>HALT problem</h4>
            
            The next issue is the implementation of the HALT functionality that is tied to the sonar interaction.<br/>
            The objective here is to stop/start the movement of the robot based on the <i>startHalt</i> and <i>stopHalt</i> Events.<br/>
            <br/>

            <k><i><b>How can we modify our model to include this behavior?</b></i></k><br/><br/>
            In the <a href="../../sprint1/userDocs/WasteService.html">Sprint1</a> we defined a complete model of the core service, which includes
            the movement of our trolley/robot.<br/><br/>

            Now, the goal is to stop the trolley either in the middle or in the beginning/end of the current path.
            In essence, we have to consider all moves inside a path to properly stop the robot at the requested moment.<br/>
            <br/>

            <h5>Using trolleymover</h5>

            The first strategy we tried to use was to modify the <ks>trolleymover</ks> actor by making him catch the <i>startHalt</i> and <i>stopHalt</i> events emitted by the <k>sonarFilter</k>
            and consequently notify the <k>pather</k> as he is the one that manages the single moves.<br/>

            So, the latter checked for the Halt messages:
            <ul>
                <li><b>After every move inside the same path</b> to intercept <i>startHalt</i> 
                during the robot's movement</li>
                <li><b>Between the end of the current path and the start of the next one</b> to cover 
                the instances where the trolley is not moving (i.e. during the pickup and dropout actions)</li>
            </ul>

            However, a new issue arises: <br/><k><i><b>How can an actor intercept an Event if he's already busy ?</b></i></k><br/><br/>
            Our pather actor is constantly executing movement tasks, which could cause the loss of Events occurring
            in an unfortunate moment (as Event messages are not queued).<br/><br/>
            
            <h5>First interruption strategy</h5>
            In the beginning we opted to completely change the strategy by modifying both the <ks>pather</ks> and the <ks>trolleymover</ks>.<br/>
            This way, with a higher perspective of the trolley's movements given by <ks>trolleymover</ks>, we could handle
            halt Events in situations where the trolley was already occupied (ex. <i>startHalt arrives while the trolley is executing a pickup action</i>).<br/>
            <br/>

            This solution, while functional, also presented issues: <br/>
            <ul>
                <li>The division of tasks between <ks>pather</ks> and <ks>trolleymover</ks> violated the <b>Single Responsibility Principle</b> as 
                both actors were required to distinguish the trolley's state.</li>
                <li>Many changes in the structure of our model were required, bringing consfusion to the internal structure of both actors</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="center">
                <img src="./imgs/sonar-mover.png">
            </div>

            <h5>Final interruption strategy</h5>
            To fix this, we reverted back to the initial strategy and added the new <ks>halteventhandler</ks> actor between <ks>sonarfilter</ks> and the <ks>pather</ks> whose only job is to intercept <i>startHalt</i>
            and <i>stopHalt</i> messages and convert them into dispatches (i.e. the behavior of a proxy) to ensure they are properly queued and received.<br/>

            <div class="center">
                <img src="./imgs/sonar-pather.png">
            </div>

            <h4>Other tools</h4>

            Considering the purpose of the problem analysis, we decided to create a mock version of the sonar to easily test our new simplified
            model.<br/><br/>

            We did so by writing a simple script in python (<a href="">trigger_stop.py</a>) that connects to the system and generates/emits
            events based on a certain interval [START, STOP]:
            <ol>
                <li>Messages are sent with a descending distance value (from STOP to START)</li>
                <li>Then, the order is reversed and messages are sent with an ascending distance value (from START to STOP)</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Led interaction analysis</h3>

            As a reminder, the led can be found in 3 states, depending on the trolley's behavior:
            <ul>
                <li><k>ON</k>: if the trolley is stopped</li>
                <li><k>OFF</k>: if the trolley is at HOME</li>
                <li><k>BLINKING</k>: if the trolley is moving</li>
            </ul>
            As described in our configuration file <a href="../sprint2_problem/resources/ws/LedState.kt">ledState.kt</a>.
            <br/>
            Of course, being a separate component (an actor, as of our Sprint0 analysis), the led will have to be notified of the current state of the trolley
            to properly change between its own states.

            <h4>What type of message do we need to notify the led ?</h4>
            The led can simply be notified of the changes in the system by events.<br/>
            Such notifications are only forwarded in case there is an effective change in the led Status.<br/><br/>

            The reasoning behind the decision of using events is that they are useful in case a certain state of the system needs to stay updated on multiple
            components.<br/>
            In fact, if we also consider that the GUI (which is not the topic of this particular Sprint) will need to stay updated on the 
            state of the led, we can see how useful it is to use Events instead of Dispatches, as the latter would require multple messages.
            
            <h4>What component notifies the led of its desired state ?</h4>
            
            <b>While analyzing this problem, we have come up with two distinct solutions:</b>

            <br/>
            <h5>Events are emitted by the trolley movement actors</h5>

            The first solution implies that the <ks>trolleymover</ks> and <ks>pather</ks> actors would emit
            events that described the state of the trolley after each <i>major change</i> in the robot's routine (es. "arrived at INDOOR", "moving to HOME", ecc.).<br/>

            <pre><code>Event stopped: stopped(_)
Event moving: moving(_)
Event at_home: at_home(_)</code></pre>


            However, the emission of events becomes strongly dependent to the logic of the actors, thus
            the implementation is less adaptive.

            <h5>The state of the trolley is observed using CoaP</h5>

            Instead, these events are emitted by our new actor <ks>trolleystateobserver</ks> which uses the recently added <k>observeResource</k> 
            functionality of Qak to observe the actors <ks>transporttrolley</ks> and <ks>pather</ks> thus implementing the <k>Observer</k> pattern.<br/>

            <pre><code>Dispatch coapUpdate: coapUpdate(RESOURCE, VALUE)
Event updateLed: moving(STATE)</code></pre>

            <pre><code>STATE := ON | OFF | BLINKING </code></pre>

            <div class="center">
                <img src="./imgs/led-problem.png">
            </div>

            <h4>Other tools</h4>

            To model a mock version of the Led we definded a simple new actor: <ks>Led</ks>.<br/>
            After every new <i>updateLed</i>, it prints the new state od the led.<br/>

            <br/>

            This is the <b>model</b> created following the problem analysis, integrating the <b>raspberry</b> and its elements in the system.<br/>
            It uses the coordinate strategy and all previously mentioned tools provided by the customer (some of them have been modified
            and will be discussed shortly).<br/>
            As usual, it was created using the <b>QAK modeling language</b> and its code can be found here:

            <h3>Implementation of Sonar functions</h3>

            <h4>Sonar Events Emission</h4>

            In the project phase we introduced a way to choose between a real sonar and a simulated sonar by changing
            the emitter of events based on the system configuration file.<br/>

            To do this we created two CodedActors, one simulator (<a href="../sprint2_project/resources/wsSonar/sonarEmitterSimulator.kt">sonarEmitterSimulator</a>)
            and one concrete sonar (<a href="../sprint2_project/resources/wsSonar/sonarEmitterConcrete.kt">sonarEmitterConcrete</a>):

            <ul>
                <li><b>sonarEmitterSimulator</b> is a mock version of the sonar that replaces the previoulsy defined trigger_stop.py.</li>
                <li><b>sonarEmitterConcrete</b> reads the data from the real sonar by executing <a href="../sprint2_project/resources/wsSonar/SonarAlone.c">sonarAlone.c</a>
                        (already mentioned in the <b>Sprint0</b>) and emits it as a localStreamEvent.<br/>
                <k><i>The objective is to run this CodedActor on the RaspberryPi to read real sonar data.</i></k>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Sonar Events Filtering</h4>

            As a first decision, we chose to change how the sonar emissions are filtered and delivered in our system.<br/>
            While in the problem analisys everything was handled by our <ks>sonarfilter</ks> actor (defined in the relative qak model), 
            we opted for a <k>reactive</k> approach by using <b>Actors as streams</b> (<b>pipe</b>).
            <br/><br/>
            <!-- TODO: immagine p.i.p.e. (piedi irsuti per eiaculazione)-->
            
            Infact, while filtering was necessary, adopting the use of normal standalone actors would have
            meant that each component of the filtering process would have sent <k>Events</k> to every actor in the context.<br/>
            This is redundant and could strain the network.<br/><br/>

            The first actor in the pipe will be either <ks>sonarEmitterSimulator</ks> or <ks>sonarEmitterConcrete</ks>, based on the configuration file.<br/>
            We have reporpoused these scripts given by the customer to achieve our goal:
            <ul>
                <li><i><b>dataCleaner</i></b><br/>
                    This CodedActor in the pipe defines an interval of distances [min, max]. If the recorded distance from our
                    emitter (real or mock) is outside that interval, the event is not propagated.<br/>
                    We do this to clean the incoming data and put less pressure on the following actors.
                </li>
                <li><i><b>distanceFilter</i></b><br/>
                    This particular CodedActor replaces our <ks>sonarfilter</ks> in the pipe by emitting the <i>startHalt</i> and <i>stopHalt</i>
                    events with the same logic.
                </li>
            </ul>
          
            <h4>Tools</h4>
            
            <h5>sonarSystemBuilder</h5>
            <dd>
                This Kotlin object simply creates the pipe by building it based on the configuration of the system.<br/>
                If we are running a simulation, it will put <ks>sonarEmitterSimulator</ks> as the first actor.<br/>
                Otherwise, it will use <ks>sonarEmitterConcrete</ks>.
            </dd>

            <h3>Implementation of Led functions</h3>

            <h4>Changes from problem analisys</h4>
            We have decided to make some <k>changes</k> to the business logic of the Led after extensive use of the system.<br/>
            Previously, our <ks>trolleystateobserver</ks> actor notified the <ks>led</ks> actor running on the raspberry context through
            <k>Events</k>.<br/><br/>

            Our <b>reasoning</b> behind this was that other components (i.e. <k>GUI</k>) were to be notified of the state of the Led.<br/>
            However this strategy could <k>saturate the network</k>, as there are many actors in our main service context.<br/><br/>

            To solve this issue, we decided to use <k>Dispatches</k> as a way to notify all required actors of the state of the Led.<br/><br/>
            So, now we use:
            <pre><code>Dispatch updateLed(STATE) 
//The possible commands do not change
STATE := ON | OFF | BLINKING </code></pre>

            <h4>Project changes</h4>

            We approched the inclusion of the real Led similarly to the Sonar.<br/>
            Which means that, in the final demo it will be possible to use both the simulated Led and the real 
            one on the raspberry.

            The customer provided us with a library that helps us in doing so: <k>it.unibo.radarSystem22</k>.<br/>
            It exposes Factories and Interfaces that can create real/mock Sonars and Led components.<br/>
            <br/>
            In our system, we are just going to use the Led portion of this library:
            <ul>
                <li><b>DeviceFactory</b>: we use it to create either a LedConcrete object (that can turn ON and OFF the REAL led)
                or a LedMock object (that changes the state of a fake led instance) based on the current System Configuration.</li>
                <li><b>ILed</b>: is an interface of the object created by the <b>DeviceFactory</b>. The methods <i>turnOn()</i> and
                <i>turnOff()</i> are used to interact with the led.</li>
            </ul>
            The previous tools are all used by our <ks>led</ks> actor, running in the raspberryPi context, to turn ON and OFF
            the real/mock led.

            <h4>LedUtils</h4>

            <b>LedUtils</b> is a wrapper we created to implement some useful methods to manage the led creation and status using DeviceFactory and ILed:
            <ul>
                <li><b>fun createLed(simulation: Boolean, ledGui: Boolean)</b>: is used to instantiate an ILed and allows us to create the led depending
                    on the necessities using the DeviceFactory previously mentioned.</li>
                <li><b>fun getLedStatusFromCoap(resource: String, value: String): LedState</b>: allows us to monitor a Coap Resource that gives the
                    informations we need to determine the current LedState.</li>
                <li><b>turnOn()</b>: turns ON the ILed.</li>
                <li><b>turnOff()</b>: turns OFF the ILed.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>System Distribution</h3>
            When it comes to the distribution of our system, we tried <b>two main strategies</b>.</br><br/>
            The first and most simple was to compile a <k>.jar</k> file for each context and launch these files on multiple devices to test the distribution.<br/>
            This stratedy worked from the beginning but we also tried something more complicated through the use of <ks>Docker</ks>.</br></br>

            We tested the Dockerized system with this configuration:
            <ul>
                <li><b>PC</b>: a <ks><i>Docker-compose.yml</i></ks> file defined so that each context had its own container.</li>
                <li><b>Raspberry</b>: a Docker-file to only run the <b><i>rasp</i></b> context.</li>
            </ul>

            Unfortunately,  connection problems external to our system prevented us from successfully distributing the system.<br/>

            <h4>System execution details</h4>
            To run the whole distributed system, follow the instructions in our <a href="">run_system_guide.txt</a> file.
